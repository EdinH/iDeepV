iDeepV: predicting RBP binding sites using vector representaiton learned from sequences with CNNs.

In this study, we test iDeepV on two datasets:
RBP-31: download from https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepS/tree/master/datasets/clip
RBP-24: download from http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/GraphProt/GraphProt_CLIP_sequences.tar.bz2
