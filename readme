iDeepV: predicting RBP binding sites using vector representaiton learned from sequences with CNNs.

In this study, we test iDeepV on two datasets:
RBP-31: download from https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepS/tree/master/datasets/clip
RBP-24: download from http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/GraphProt/GraphProt_CLIP_sequences.tar.bz2

RNA2Vec.py is used to learn embdeddings for k-mers
iDpeepV.py is used to perform the predictions of RBP binding sites, the user only need change the code to show which dataset to test. And reproduce the results in paper.
